# Aggregate Table Script

# You should create a table of aggregate information about it. 
# It must perform a groupby operation to show a dimension of 
#the dataset as grouped by a particular feature (column).
#We expect the included table to:
# 1.Have well formatted (i.e., human readable) column names 
# (so you'll probably have to change them)
# 2.Only contain relevant information (i.e., only select some columns of interest)
# 3.Be intentionally sorted in a meaningful way
# 4.Round any quantitative values so they are displayed in a manner that 
# isn't distracting
#When you display the table in your index.Rmd file, you must also describe 
#why you included the table, and what information it reveals.
