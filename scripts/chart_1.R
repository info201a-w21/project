# Chart Script 1
# create a visualization of your data
#Each chart must return a different type of visualization (e.g., you can only 
#create one Scatter Plot,one map, one bar chart, etc.).  
#Again, in your report you must describe why you included the chart 
#(e.g., what it attempts to seeks to express), and what information it reveals. 
#For each chart, we expect the following:

#Chart types are intentionally selected to reveal particular patterns in the dataset
#Optimal graphical encodings are selected to present the data in the most interpretable way
#For two dimensional plots, X, Y axis labels are set with clear human readable titles
#When appropriate, the chart has a title
#A legend is present for any color encodings
#If a legend is present, the legend label has been set to be easily readable
#If a legend is present, the legend doesn't run off the page (this means you 
# should not be using more than ~10 colors)

#When you display each chart in your index.Rmd file, you must:
#Describe the purpose of including the chart
#Describe any notable observations and insights from the chart
